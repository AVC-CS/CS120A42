//?  [Problem Definition]
//*     Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and
//*     the distance it is to beshipped, and then displays the charges.
//** Input Validation :
//* 	Do not accept values of 0 or less for the weight of the package.
//* 	Do not accept weights of more than 20 kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship).
//* 	Do not accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles.
//*     These are the companyâ€™s minimum and maximum shipping distances.
